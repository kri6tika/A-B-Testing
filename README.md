# A-B-Testing
A/B testing is a method used by companies to check whether a number of changes proposed on their product(or web page)would bring them better customer conversion rate or not . Two  identical groups, both heterogeneous and comprehensive, are taken. One is called the control group (A) that is given the old product and  another is called the treatment group(B) that is given the modified product. If the chosen metric shows a considerable difference in the two groups with significant probability we say... bring on the changes!
